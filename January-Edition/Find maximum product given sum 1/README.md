# Approach

## Pre requisites
1. Math

## Brute force
1. We can try to find the product of all X.(S-X) , where X goes from 1 to S-1.
2. But Time complexity will go to O(S).
3. Is there an optimal way to do this?

## Code Snippet
```
def solution(S):
    # Write your code here
    val = S/2 + 1
    
    result = S - val + 1
    
    return math.floor(result * result)
```

## Optimal solution - math 
1. It is known that, given sum X+Y=S, the maximum product X.Y occurs if X and Y are both S/2.
2. It is one of the very first thing we prove in calculus!

4. Time complexity: O(1)
